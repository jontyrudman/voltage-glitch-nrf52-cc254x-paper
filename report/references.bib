  abstract = {Voltage fault injection is a powerful active side channel attack that modifies the execution-flow of a device by creating disturbances on the power supply line. The attack typically aims at skipping security checks or generating side-channels that gradually leak sensitive data, including the firmware code. In this paper we propose a new voltage fault injection technique that generates fully arbitrary voltage glitch waveforms using off-the-shelf and low cost equipment. To show the effectiveness of our setup, we present new, unpublished firmware extraction attacks on six microcontrollers from three major manufacturers: STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Renesas Electronics that, in 2016 declared a market of \$1.5 billion, \$800 million and \$2.5 billion on units sold, respectively. Among the presented attacks, the most challenging ones exploit multiple vulnerabilities and inject over one million glitches, heavily leveraging on the performance and repeatability of the new proposed technique. We perform a thorough evaluation of arbitrary glitch waveforms by comparing the attack performance against two other major V-FI techniques in the literature. Along a responsible disclosure policy, all the vulnerabilities have been timely reported to the manufacturers.},

In particular, modeling faults and finding effective practical approaches that are also generic is considered to be of interest for smart card industry. In this work we propose a novel methodology to deal with a difficult question of choosing multiple parameters required for effective faults. To this aim, we investigate several algorithms and find a new promising direction using evolutionary computation. Our experimental results on some of the smart cards used today show the potential of this new approach. Our best algorithm is a tailored search strategy especially developed for the purpose of finding the best choice of parameters for glitching. With this approach we found some of off-the-shelf devices, although secured against this type of attacks, still vulnerable.},

This, however, increases the potential attack vectors since any one of these connected IoT devices can be targeted to facilitate other malicious cyber activities. Physical attacks are generally harder to mitigate and less studied, in comparison to their cyber counterparts. Thus, in this paper we present an attack framework targeting true random number generators (TRNGs), which are a key component in cryptosystems for edge devices. We then demonstrate how such a framework can guide our investigation of a commercial ASIC chip that runs ring-oscillator-based TRNG. Specifically, we show that our template power attack, low voltage fault attack, and voltage glitch fault attack do not require prior knowledge of the TRNG implementation.},

One technique to generate such faults is to manipulate the supply voltage of the device. This paper introduces a novel technique to introduce those supply voltage manipulations onto existing digital systems, requiring minimal modifications to the device being attacked. This uses a crowbar to short the power supply for controlled periods of time. High-accuracy faults are demonstrated on the 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which can generate both single and multi-bit faults with high repeatability. Additionally this technique is demonstrated on a FPGA where it is capable of generating faults in both internal registers and the configuration fabric.},

Fault injection techniques such as voltage or clock glitching have been proven successful in bypassing such protection for specific microcontrollers, but this often requires expensive equipment and/or exhaustive search of the fault parameters. When multiple glitches are required (e.g., when countermeasures are in place) this search becomes of exponential complexity and thus infeasible. Another challenge which makes embedded bootloaders notoriously hard to analyse is their lack of debugging capabilities.},

Information provided by Texas Instruments reveals that one of our voltage fault injection attacks abuses functionality that is left over from the integrated circuit manufacturing process. The demonstrated physical attack allows an adversary to extract the firmware (i.e. intellectual property) and to bypass secure boot. Additionally, we mount side-channel attacks and differential fault analysis attacks on the hardware AES co-processor. To demonstrate the practical applicability of these attacks we extract the firmware from a Tesla Model 3 key fob.},
