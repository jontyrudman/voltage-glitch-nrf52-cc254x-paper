# Jonathan Rudman (jxr814)

Welcome to my project repo.

- Firmware and glitching helper code for each MCU is in directories `cc2541` and `nrf52832`.
- Python files for recording power traces and some messy differential power analysis files are in `general/record_and_dpa`.
- Messy and, in places, outdated notes are in the `notes` directory.

Enjoy!
