## Fault Injection - Electronics and soldering

- Play with the clock and voltage to break crypto, get the firmware, etc.
- Replicate AirTags exploit. There are also about 10 exploits David has that I could replicate as practise.
- David wrote a paper last year called Fill your Boots (...). Check this out.

## Capability Architectures - FPGA programming

- Capability architectures like CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhances RISC Instructions), VexRiscv
- A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority that refers to a value which, in turn, refers to an object and a set of corresponding access rights.
- SpinalHDL uses Scala to generate Verilog.
- Memory encryption is yet to be implemented on the core that David is helping create (implementation similar to CHERI).
- CHERI is being worked on by Cambridge University and Arm.

## General Information

- Weekly meetings with all his undergrads as a status update and can be useful to find commonalities.
- Take notes and use git throughout.
- Write the report near the end.
