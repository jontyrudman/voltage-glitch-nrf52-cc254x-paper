# Stretch Goals

- Allow giant (python) code to be installed as a python module.
- Make giant (python) code more modular and reusable for different kinds of voltage glitching techniques.
- Experiment with different VCC signals on chips with CPU voltage regulators, as an easier alternative to removing a decoupling capacitor.
